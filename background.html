    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>I possess a robust foundation in physics and mathematics,
         having completed my FSc in Pre-Engineering with distinction.
          Building on this solid base, 
          I pursued higher education in Computational Physics,
           where I delved into the intriguing intersection of theoretical physics and computational techniques. This unique blend of knowledge has equipped me with a profound understanding of complex physical systems and the expertise to analyze and simulate them using cutting-edge computational tools. With a strong analytical mindset and problem-solving skills, I am well-prepared to 
        tackle challenging projects and drive innovation in various fields.</p>
